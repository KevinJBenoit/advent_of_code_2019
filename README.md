# Advent of Code 2019 
### By Kevin Benoit

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) is a seasonal contest designed to test a programmer's skill and creativity in solving
given puzzels through code.

These daily challenges tested my knoweldge of Data Structures and Algorithms in order to solve them efficiently.
Several puzzles built off of previous ones, and the use of OOP was helpful in expanding on existing functionality to generate more complex programs.

This year I managed to make complete day 11.
